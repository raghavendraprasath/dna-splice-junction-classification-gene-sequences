# üß¨ Predicting Splice Junctions in DNA Sequences Using Machine Learning

> **‚ÄúClassifying exon-intron boundaries through intelligent sequence decoding ‚Äì merging genomics with machine learning.‚Äù**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project explores a machine learning-driven approach to **classify DNA sequences into splice site types** ‚Äì a critical problem in bioinformatics. The classification includes:
- **EI (Exon-Intron junction)**
- **IE (Intron-Exon junction)**
- **N (Non-Splice sites)**

We apply **Python and R-based modeling**, robust **feature engineering**, and **biological pattern visualizations** to enhance gene annotation accuracy.

---

## üß† Problem Statement
Splice junction detection is pivotal for gene expression and protein synthesis analysis. Traditional motif-based methods lack flexibility for diverse biological sequences. Our challenge was to:
- Handle **high-dimensional DNA data**
- Extract meaningful nucleotide patterns
- Apply ML models to learn splice site features automatically
